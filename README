Measure latency of RAM by performing pseudo-random lookups.

This program fills a buffer of a specified size with pseudo-random bytes,
using random(), and then does lookups in that buffer where the address of
each subsequent lookup depends on the bytes retrieved during the previous
lookup.  The effect of pre-fetching is also tested.


COMPILING:

  cmake .
  make


RUNNING:

  $ ./mlat 64

  buffer size: 64 MiB

  starting basic test...
  latency: 24ns [50422]

  starting prefetch[2] test...
  latency: 48ns [44708]

  starting prefetch[3] test...
  latency: 33ns [12054]

  starting prefetch[4] test...
  latency: 25ns [20943]

  starting prefetch[6] test...
  latency: 18ns [29819]

  starting prefetch[8] test...
  latency: 15ns [5611]

  starting prefetch[12] test...
  latency: 13ns [27279]

  starting prefetch[16] test...
  latency: 12ns [25448]

The arbitrary number is square brackets (e.g. [25448]) should be ignored.  It
is printed out just to ensure the compiler does not optimize away the main
loop.  

The other number of in square brackets (e.g. prefetch[12]) is the depth of the
prefetching.
